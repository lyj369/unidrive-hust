UniDrive is a consumer multi-cloud application that synergizes multiple consumer cloud storage services (CCSs) like Dropbox and OneDrive to provide more reliable and secure file storage as well as extremely faster multi-device synchronization services.

UniDrive provides the same interface as a CCS application such as Dropbox, automatically synchronizes files in your local sync folder to multiple CCSs, and then to your other devices.

Compared to products like Dropbox, UniDrive is more advanced for:

  * **More reliability**: Are you still worrying about temporal outages of clouds? UniDrive does not depend on any specific cloud, and remains full functional even when a fraction of clouds are not available.
  * **Higher security**: Are you concerning privacy and vendor lock-in issues? UniDrive encodes or encrypts user files before the data transmission. No single provider can have your data in integrity.
  * **Better performance**: Are you complaining about the limited space and slow speed? UniDrive aggregates multiple clouds to enlarge your storage, and utilizes parallel transfer and exploits faster clouds to boost networking performance. It is able to provide a uniform user experience across locations and at any time.
  * **Easier management**: Are you troubled by your multiple CCS accounts? UniDrive provides a unified interface to manage all your CCS accounts and files stored in each cloud.

Currently, UniDrive supports the following CCSs:

  * Dropbox
  * OneDrive
  * Google Drive
  * BaiduPCS
  * DBank
